Hash Tables

Imagine the following table:

Cow     Side
------------
3         0
1         1
4         0
...       ...

This is a great way to store data. However, what happens if the id for a cow takes up too much space?
The solution for this issue is to 'hash' the id. A hash function should be able to map any of these ids to a somewhat randomly generated smaller number.

What is a hash function?
It is a function h(int key) which returns another, smaller, integer which maps specifically to that key.
