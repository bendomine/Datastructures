This code is undocumented, it doesn't follow any real standards, and I'm not even sure it works. Also this readme provides almost no information.

The only thing I can guarantee is that it was not written by an Irishman.

Oh yeah, one last thing. I'm using a different version of the textbook I found online, so I have no idea if I actually wrote the right code as the page numbers are different. I read the section indicated and wrote the code it contained, so I hope that was correct.
