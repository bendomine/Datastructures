Every graph contains its edges and values.
Each edge contains its pairings with vertices, and each value has the things we would like to identify/measure.

class Vertex{
	int id;
	public Vertex (int _id) {id = _id;}
}

class Edge{
	// Directed graph, each vertex is one-way
	Vertex start;
	Vertex end;
	int weight;
	public Edge (Vertex v1, Vertex v2, int _weight){
		start = v1;
		end = v2;
		weight = _weight;
	}
}

Let's use an example where each vertex represents a city and each node represents a node.
